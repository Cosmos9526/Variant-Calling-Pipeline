# Variant-Calling-Pipeline
 pipeline performs variant calling using Strelka, FreeBayes, VarScan, and GATK HaplotypeCaller. Input files include a BAM file and a VCF file. The pipeline generates recalibrated BAM files and a consensus VCF file containing variant calls. The final VCF file serves as input for VEP annotation, producing a comprehensive variant report.
